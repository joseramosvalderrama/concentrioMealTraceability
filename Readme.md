## Idea

Create a fullstack app for our favourite work lunch places.

The idea is that the user votes for their daily work meal, so we could have a traceability of the best meals of each kantine and a overall score of each one.

Another idea is making a quick scrap to the kantina's web for having all the menus in the same place!

This will be the definite app for concentrio meals!

## Technologies

I thought about making a simple backend api using node and express. It could be connected to a simple mongodb, postgresql or mysql.

For the frontend I feel more confident with react and we can use a css tool like bootstrap or tailwind.

## Launch database

` docker compose up -d`
