## Idea

Create a fullstack app for our favourite work lunch places.

The idea is that the user votes for their daily work meal, so we could have a traceability of the best meals of each kantine and a overall score of each one.

Another idea is making a quick scrap to the kantina's web for having all the menus in the same place!

This will be the definite app for concentrio meals!

First mvp of the app has been created and is about to be delivered. Looking forward for first user feedback!
